Library based on [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org) to solve optimization problems in Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS).
The techniques implemented here are based on the paper [Shortest Paths in Graphs of Convex Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11565) by Tobia Marcucci, Jack Umenberger, Pablo A. Parrilo, and Russ Tedrake.

Warning: The library is still under development and not thoroughly tested yet.
